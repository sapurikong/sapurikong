# Hi 
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in CS.
(I majored in physics for four years though never graduated)

I'm good at:

Rust 🦀 (my favourite language, plenty of experience as a hobby, 3 months of internship experience.)
C++ 🪄(my ex-favourite, plenty of experience as a hobby, one year of part-time work experience)
Google-fu (always helping friends Google)
resolving others' trouble (not good at resolving my own, unfortunately)
I know the basics of:

Java (learnt at the university)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (unless involving "modern" toolchains)
Vue3 (only 26 hours of learning, just for one coding test)
